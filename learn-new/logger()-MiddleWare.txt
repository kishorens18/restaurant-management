The line of code router.Use(gin.Logger()) registers the gin.Logger() middleware with the router. The gin.Logger() middleware logs all HTTP requests and responses. This includes the request method, the request path, the response status code, and the response size. The logs can be helpful for debugging and monitoring your application.

The Use() method registers a middleware function with the router. The middleware function is executed before or after a handler is called. Middleware can be used to add common functionality to all requests, such as logging, authentication, and rate limiting.

The gin.Logger() middleware is a very useful middleware function. It can help you to debug your application and to monitor its performance.

Here is an example of how to use the gin.Logger() middleware with the Gin router:

router := gin.New()
router.Use(gin.Logger())
router.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{
        "message": "Hello, world!",
    })
})
This code registers the gin.Logger() middleware with the router and defines a route that will respond to all HTTP GET requests to the root path. The handler for this route will simply return a JSON response with the message "Hello, world!".

The gin.Logger() middleware is a simple way to add logging to your Gin application. It is a good starting point for building web applications in Go.
