The validator package is a Golang package that provides functions for validating data.

The validate.Struct() method validates the struct against a set of validation rules. The validation rules are specified in the validator package.

If the struct is valid, the validate.Struct() method returns nil. If the struct is invalid, the validate.Struct() method returns an error.

The var validate = validator.New() line of code creates a new instance of the validator struct. The validator struct is used to validate data.
